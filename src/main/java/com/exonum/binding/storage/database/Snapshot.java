/**
 * A snapshot is a read-only, immutable database view.
 *
 * <p>A snapshot represents database state at the time it was created. Immutability implies that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Write operations are prohibited; an attempt to perform a modifying operation
 *       will result in a RuntimeException</li>
 *   <li>Database state will not change whilst a snapshot is alive.
 *       As a snapshot requires a growing amount of memory resources as services write
 *       to the database, do <strong>not</strong> keep Snapshots alive for extended periods of time.
 *       Close them as soon as you are finished with them.</li>
 * </ul>
