# Prepare environment variables for building and running tests.
# This requires executables and libraries to be able to find libjvm and Rust stdlib.
#
# ¡Keep it MacOS/Ubuntu compatible!
#
# This profile contains:
# - JAVA_HOME - path to currently selected JDK, required to build jni-rs
#   with the invocation feature.
# - JAVA_LIB_DIR - path to libjvm.
# - RUST_LIB_DIR - path to Rust stdlib.
# - RUST_COMPILER_VERSION - Rust version for building tests.
# - RUSTFLAGS - Rust build options augmented with "rpath" option for JAVA_LIB_DIR and RUST_LIB_DIR.
#   These options will make the linker add paths to the libjvm and the Rust standard library
#   to the runtime search paths.
#
#   The runtime search paths, set by "rpath" option, work similarly on Linux and MacOS.
#   On Linux the linker adds the entries to RUNPATH section in the binary, which is scanned
#   after LD_LIBRARY_PATH. [1]
#   On MacOS the linker adds load commands with paths to the libraries to the end
#   of the runtime search list. Therefore, the load commands for these libraries
#   *at the beginning* (@rpath/libNAME.dylib entries) will succeed in case the library is
#   available in the default system directories or in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. [2]
#
#   If you need to override the libjvm, set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to specify the path to it.
#
#   "rpath" option in RUSTFLAGS variable affects all executables and dynamic libraries
#   we build: the application, integration tests, libjava_bindings shared library.
#
#   It is worth mentioning that recent releases of MacOS with enabled by default SIP
#   clear LD_LIBRARY_PATH when new shell started.
#   Such behavior greatly affects Maven and all that it runs.
#   Setting rpath is a good way to fix this flaw in tests.
#   On Linux, it is not important whether to prefer RUNPATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
