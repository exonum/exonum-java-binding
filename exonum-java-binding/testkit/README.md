# TestKit

Exonum Java Binding provides a powerful testing toolkit - TestKit.
TestKit allows testing transaction execution in the synchronous environment by offering simple
network emulation (that is, without consensus algorithm and network operation involved).

For more details and a guide on how to use TestKit in your tests, see
[documentation][exonum-testkit].
