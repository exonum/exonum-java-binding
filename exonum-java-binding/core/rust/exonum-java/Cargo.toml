# Specify the "resource-manager" feature explicitly to prevent issues with linking (see ECR-2855).
# Although its primary goal is to detect _programming_ errors that shall not occur
# in a correct application early, it is currently required in the application
# because some public APIs in Java permit passing arbitrary pointers (e.g., Snapshot#newInstance).
