/**
 * A schema of the collections (a.k.a. indices) of a service.
 *
 * <p>To verify the integrity of the database state on each node in the network,
 * Exonum automatically tracks every Merkelized collection used by the user
 * services. It aggregates state hashes of these collections into a single
 * Merkelized meta-map. The hash of this meta-map is considered the hash of the
 * entire blockchain state and is recorded as such in {@linkplain Block#getStateHash() blocks}
 * and Precommit messages.
 *
 * <p>Exonum starts aggregating a service collection state hash once it is <em>initialized</em>:
 * created for the first time with a {@link com.exonum.binding.core.storage.database.Fork}.
 *
 * <p>Please note that if the service does not use any Merkelized collections,
 * the framework will not be able to verify that its transactions cause the same
 * results on different nodes.
