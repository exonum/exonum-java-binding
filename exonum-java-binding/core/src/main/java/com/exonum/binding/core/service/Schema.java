/**
 * A schema of the collections (a.k.a. indices) of a service.
 *
 * <p>To verify the integrity of the database state on each node in the network,
 * the core automatically tracks every Merkelized collection used by the user
 * services. It aggregates state hashes of these collections into a single
 * Merkelized meta-map. The hash of this meta-map is considered the hash of the
 * entire blockchain state and is recorded as such in blocks and Precommit
 * messages.
 *
 * <p>Please note that if the service does not use any Merkelized collections,
 * the framework will not be able to verify that its transactions cause the same
 * results on different nodes.
