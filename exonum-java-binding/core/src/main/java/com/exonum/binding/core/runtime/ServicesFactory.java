 * in its present form, abstract the instantiation mechanism (Guice), as it requires the service
 * definition with a Guice module providing service bindings. It is a deliberate design decision
 * to not over-abstract the interaction between the service loader producing
 * the service definition; the factory consuming it to make a service instance;
 * and their client â€” the runtime.
