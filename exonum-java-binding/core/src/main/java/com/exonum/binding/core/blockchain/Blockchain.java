 *      to create various blockchain proofs from their components.

 * <h2 id="proofs">Proofs</h2>
 *
 * <p>Blockchain allows creating cryptographic proofs that some data is indeed stored
 * in the database. Exonum supports the following types of proofs:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Block Proof</li>
 *   <li>Transaction Execution Proof</li>
 *   <li>Call Result Proof</li>
 *   <li>Service Data Proof</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3 id="block-proof">Block Proof</h3>
 *
 * <p>A block proof proves correctness of a blockchain block. It can be created with
 * {@link #createBlockProof(long)} for any committed block. See also {@link BlockProof}.
 *
 * <h3 id="tx-execution-proof">Transaction Execution Proof</h3>
 *
 * <p>A transaction execution proof proves that a transaction with a given message hash was
 * executed in a block at a certain height at a certain
 * <em>{@linkplain TransactionLocation location}</em>. It consists of a block proof,
 * and a list proof from {@link #getBlockTransactions(long)}. It may be extended to
 * a <em>call result</em> proof — read the next section.
 *
 * <h3 id="call-result-proof">Call Result Proof</h3>
 *
 * <p>A call result proof proves that a given service call completed with a particular
 * result in a block at a certain height. It consists of a block proof and a map proof
 * from {@link #getCallErrors(long)}. In case of <em>transaction</em> calls, it also
 * includes a list proof from {@link #getBlockTransactions(long)}.
 *
 * <h3 id="service-data-proof">Service Data Proof</h3>
 *
 * <p>A service data proof proves that some service index contains certain data as of the last
 * committed block. It includes:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>An index proof: a block proof + a proof from the aggregating collection.</li>
 *   <li>A proof from the service index.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>An index proof is created with {@link #createIndexProof(String)}.
 *
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 *
 * <p>Consider a simple timestamping service that keeps timestamps for event ids, and supports
 * proofs of their authenticity.
 *
 * <p>First, create a message definition for a proof:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   message TimestampProof {
 *     MapProof timestamp = 1;
 *     IndexProof indexProof = 2;
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Then create the two components: timestamp proof from a service index and index proof
 * for that index from the blockchain:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TimestampProof createTimestampProof(Snapshot s,
 *                                       String eventId) {
 *     // 1. Create a timestamp proof
 *     // The literal is for illustrative purposes —
 *     // usually the service name is prepended elsewhere
 *     var fullIndexName = "timestamping.timestamp";
 *     var timestamps = ProofMapIndexProxy.newInstance(fullIndexName, s,
 *         string(), timestamp());
 *     var tsProof = timestamps.getProof(eventId);
 *
 *     // 2. Create an index proof
 *     var blockchain = Blockchain.newInstance(s);
 *     var indexProof = blockchain.createIndexProof(fullIndexName);
 *
 *     // 3. Create a complete service data proof
 *     return TimestampProof.newBuilder()
 *       .setTimestamp(tsProof.getAsMessage())
 *       .setIndexProof(indexProof.getAsMessage())
 *       .build();
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Finally, serialize the proof and send it to the client.
 *
 * <hr/>
 *
 * <p>All method arguments are non-null by default.
 * <!-- TODO: Link a page on proofs from exonum.com when one arrives: ECR-4106 -->
