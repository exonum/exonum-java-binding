/**
 * Indicates that a method is a transaction method. The annotated method should execute the
 * transaction, possibly modifying the blockchain state.
 *
 * <p>The method should be a {@code public} {@link Service} method.
 *
 * <h3>Parameters</h3>
 *
 * <p>The annotated method shall have the following parameters (in this particular order):
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>transaction arguments either as {@code byte[]} or as a protobuf message. Protobuf messages
 *       are deserialized using a {@code #parseFrom(byte[])} method
 *   <li>transaction execution context as {@link TransactionContext}. It allows to access the
 *       information about this transaction and modify the blockchain state through the included
 *       database fork.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Exceptions</h3>
 *
 * <p>The annotated method might throw {@linkplain ExecutionException} if the transaction cannot be
 * executed normally and has to be rolled back. The transaction will be committed as failed (error
 * kind {@linkplain ErrorKind#SERVICE SERVICE}). The {@linkplain ExecutionError#getCode() error
 * code} with the optional description will be saved in the storage.
 *
 * <p>If the annotated method throws any other exception, it is considered an unexpected error. The
 * transaction will be committed as failed (error kind {@linkplain ErrorKind#UNEXPECTED
 * UNEXPECTED}).
 *
 * <p>Exonum rolls back any changes made by a transaction that threw an exception. It also saves any
 * error into {@linkplain Blockchain#getCallErrors(long) the registry of call errors}. The
 * transaction clients can request the error information to know the reason of the failure.
