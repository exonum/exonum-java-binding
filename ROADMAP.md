# Java Binding Roadmap

Below are the features we intend to work on:

* Better documentation — improved user guide and tutorials.
* More example projects to hack with.
* Pre-built packaged Exonum App.
* Full support of Exonum proofs, including block proofs 
  for [blockchain clients](https://exonum.com/doc/version/latest/architecture/clients/).
* [Time oracle](https://exonum.com/doc/version/latest/advanced/time/) service bundled in the app.
* An SDK to ease integration with the blockchain application, including
  support for creating and signing transaction messages and verification of proofs.
* Easier testing with JUnit 5 extension for automatic life cycle management,
  dependency injection and Exonum test kit [functionality](https://exonum.com/doc/version/latest/advanced/service-testing/).
* Support for multiple Java services in a system.
