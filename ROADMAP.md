# Java Binding Roadmap

Below are the features we intend to work on:

* Better documentation — improved user guide and tutorials.
* More example projects to hack with.
* Pre-built packaged Exonum App.
* Full support of Exonum proofs, including block proofs 
  for [blockchain clients](https://exonum.com/doc/architecture/clients/).
* Rich APIs to access the [framework state](https://exonum.com/doc/architecture/storage/#system-tables).
* System services bundled in the app: 
  [configuration](https://exonum.com/doc/advanced/configuration-updater/),
  [time oracle](https://exonum.com/doc/advanced/time/)
  and [anchoring service](https://exonum.com/doc/get-started/design-overview/#anchoring-service).
* An SDK to ease integration with the blockchain application, including 
  support for creating and signing transaction messages and proof verification.
* Support for multiple Java services in a system.
* UX improvements: new transaction messages, better serialization support, boilerplate reduction.
