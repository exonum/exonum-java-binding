### Added

- Standard services may be enabled using specific `ejb_app_services.toml` file.
  It supports only `configuration` and `btc-anchoring` services at the moment.

  To enable services put `ejb_app_services.toml` file into EJB App's directory
  with the following content: 

  ```toml
  services = ["configuration", "btc-anchoring"]
  ```

  Configuration service is enabled by default. (#338, #313)

  (`BinaryMessage#getMessageNoSignature` and `BinaryMessage#getSignedMessage` respectively).
  (#339)

- Added methods to sign transaction messages and verify their signatures. (#341)

- Enabled passing extra arguments to the JVM from the command line.
  Use `--ejb-jvm-args` flag to specify an additional argument, e.g., 
  `--ejb-jvm-args=Xmx2g`. (#342)

### Changed

- Prepended `/api` before the path to the REST API endpoints of a service. (#340)
