## Unreleased

## 0.3.0 - 2019-07-22

The third release of Exonum Java Light Client which improves
a convenience in working with blocks and allows
specifying a custom path prefix to Exonum API.

### Versions Support
- Exonum version, 0.11.0
- Exonum Java Binding version, 0.6.0-0.7.0

### Added
- `ExonumClient#findNonEmptyBlocks` to find a certain number of the most recent non-empty
  blocks (from the last block and up to the genesis block). (#953)
- Prefix URL can be set for routing all Light Client requests. (#997) 

### Changed
- `ExonumClient#getBlocks` accepts a closed range of block heights _[from; to]_
  and returns only the blocks which heights fall into that range. The size of
  the range _(to - from + 1)_ is no longer limited. If needed, the client
  performs multiple requests to the node. (#953)
- `ExonumClient#getLastBlocks` returns only the blocks from the closed range 
  _[max(0, blockchainHeight - count + 1), blockchainHeight]_. The size of
  the range _(min(count, blockchainHeight + 1))_ is no longer limited. (#953)
- Now port is optional in the Exonum host URL. (#997)
