   * and blockchain state:
   * The value is equal to {@code heightMax + 1} if heightMax request parameter is passed.
   * If the heightMax request parameter is greater then last committed block height at the moment
   * then blocksRangeEnd value will be equal to {@code last_committed_block.height + 1}.
   * If some blocks in the range do not match the search criteria then:
   * {@code blocksRangeEnd - blocksRangeStart != blocks.size}.
