// todo: I don't like that this class is vaguely defined (just as the endpoint) as SystemStatistics,
//    because it is unclear what kind of things a user can find inside unless they look here.
//    A related consideration is if we shall keep ExonumClient#getNumUnconfirmedTransactions
//    or replace it with ExonumClient#getSystemStats â€” which does not tell what kind of stats
//    a user can find there, but allows to add new statistics if needed without increasing the
//    direct size of ExonumClient API.
